_Performing a SIM swap won't prevent people using your device on other UK networks, nor will it prevent people selling it, so I strongly recommend against this method._

First, try locating your phone via [Find My iPhone](https://www.icloud.com/#find) or [Android's Find My Device](https://www.google.com/search?q=find+my+device). You can remotely lock your device via the respective links, as well as locate, or ring them.

Afterwards, you'll want to report your SIM and Phone as lost or stolen. This prevents people using them on any UK Network, as well as stops people selling them to phone recycling companies. This will also suspend your giffgaff account to prevent unauthorised charges.

**To bar your phone and SIM, please follow these instructions:**

1. Please go to this URL: https://www.giffgaff.com/support/lost
2. Select 'Bar my phone & SIM'
3. Choose 'Bar my phone & SIM' again

giffgaff will send you a new SIM via 1st Class Post to use in a phone of your choice. It should arrive within 1-3 working days.

**The new SIM will arrive in packaging shown below.**

All genuine giffgaff URLs will start with either \`giffgaff.com\` or \`giff.ly\`.

### Information about smishing

[spoiler]

This is another variation of a scam designed to get you to hand over personal and financial details. The scammers fake the message information to make it look like it came from any number or name they choose. In this case they normally pick 443, 43430, or "giffgaff". This lets them fool many victims into responding, believing the message to be genuine.

### Advice if you've clicked the link

[spoiler]

Please do not enter any details and, if you have clicked on the link, follow these steps immediately.

1. Change the password to your giffgaff account: https://www.giffgaff.com/support/lost-password

2. Verify all your account details are correct: https://www.giffgaff.com/profile/details

3. Let giffgaff know about the scam so they can tell you about what to do next. Please tell them if you have gotten a text saying a SIM swap is about to be performed: [Account misuse and security issues](https://support2.giffgaff.com/app/ask/Account-misuse-and-security-issues/Account-misuse-and-security-issues/form/)

4. If you suspect your bank details may have been compromised as a result, alert your bank as soon as possible.

5. Change any passwords on any other accounts outside of giffgaff that use the same login info.

giffgaff and most UK networks don't plan to implement it soon (for what I know) but you can manually enable it to work via Google's servers instead. The downside is that everyone else also has to enable it and use Google Messages.

1. Download [Google Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) on your Android phone
3. Open up Google Messages and click through the tutorial, then set it as your default SMS app when it asks

You can spend up to **63 days within a 4 month period in the EU under the Roam Like At Home** (RLAH) policy. Any usage outside of this period is subject to small charges for goodybag users (0.36p/MB for data, 3.2p/minute for calls and 1p/text for texts). Pay As You Go users will still be charged the [normal UK rates](https://www.giffgaff.com/pricing).

When visiting any country listed at the bottom of this post, network usage (calls, texts, data) will cost exactly the same as when you're at home in the UK. Sweet, right?

#### Important message about Â£20 and Â£25 goodybags

[spoiler]

Please note that the Always On (Â£25) and Â£20 goodybags will be limited to 20 GB data when roaming in the EU, instead of the "normal" (technically a special offer) 80 GB. This is detailed when you are buying a goodybag, as well as on the [goodybags page](https://www.giffgaff.com/sim-only-plans) (under [color=#074984]**More info**[/color] on the applicable goodybags). After the 20 GB is up, you'll be charged 0.36p/MB.

#### Roaming Terms

[spoiler]

To prevent breaking the fair use policy, **giffgaff recommend avoiding**:

> * Using their services for the first time outside of the UK;
> * Using a large volume of your allowance in the EU and our other selected destinations (excluding the UK); or
> * Using their services and travelling within the EU and our other selected destinations for prolonged periods which donât follow reasonable consumer holiday and travel patterns and behaviour.

Please remember that the examples above arenât an exhaustive list of how you could breaching giffgaff's Fair Usage Policy. Other activities which giffgaff believe to be outside of legitimate consumer use may also be subject to the terms in this Fair Usage Policy.

    content: `If your phone asks for a Network PIN or Network Unlock Code, it means that your device is locked to another mobile network.

To use giffgaff, you have to have a device either locked to O2, giffgaff or unlocked. Please note that devices locked to other O2 MVNOs (e.g. Tesco)  will **not** work.

As your device is locked, you'll need to contact your old network for an unlock code, or take it to a local phone shop.

You can find out how to unlock your phone on the [giffgaff unlockapedia](https://www.giffgaff.com/unlock/unlocking-quick-start-guide-faq). Please note that unlocking your phone via a 3^rd party will [likely void your device's warranty](https://www.giffgaff.com/unlock/mobile-phone-unlocking-affect-warranty-faq) so, if your device is still covered under warranty and that matters to you, you'll want to contact your previous network to unlock it.`,

    content: `All giffgaff phones are sold unlocked for use on any network you please.

Sometimes, the phones can lock themselves for some reason. This is more common with iPhones.

Often, a factory reset (with your new network's SIM card installed) can solve the problem. If this doesn't work, you'll need to contact an agent for an unlock code.

You can contact a giffgaff agent at this link: https://support2.giffgaff.com/app/ask/Getting-Started/Unlocking-my-phone/form/

Agents always aim to respond within 24 hours (in some busy periods it can take up to 48 hours). It usually only takes 3-5 hours. Agents work everyday between 8 am and 11 pm.

When you get a response, you will receive a text and email alert telling you. You can view the response either from the bottom of your giffgaff dashboard, or by clicking this link: https://www.giffgaff.com/support/questions`,

    content: `Have a look through these great troubleshooting steps that I've put together for you.

## Troubleshooting steps

### Check your local masts

[spoiler]

Have a look and check that the network isn't down in your area: https://giffgaff.com/coverage-and-service#network

If it is, you can sign up for text alerts when the problem is solved here: https://status.o2.co.uk

[/spoiler]

### New member?

[spoiler]

Are you new to giffgaff? If so, you might need to wait for up to 24 hours for your SIM to be fully activated.

Usually this happens much quicker (within 30 mins or so) but in some periods, it can take longer.

[/spoiler]

### APN settings

[spoiler]

Please check if your APN settings are correct. Sometimes they are only partially set up.

If you use an iPhone, please follow this Apple Support guide to change your APN settings: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201699

If you use an Android device, head to Settings, Mobile Networks/Wireless & Networks, Mobile Network, APNs. After click the 'Add' or 'New' button (it may be hidden behind 3 dots).

Enter the APN values shown below. Please note that some fields may not be shown on all devices, so you might not have to enter all of these.

### Manual roam

[spoiler]

See this great guide to perform a manual roam: https://www.giffgaff.com/help/articles/how-to-perform-a-manual-roam

This can often fix all sorts of strange issues you're having.

[/spoiler]

### Faulty SIM

[spoiler]

If it's still not working, your SIM might be faulty. This can just happen at random, but it's easy to replace your SIM.

You'll need to perform a SIM swap. This is where you keep your number, credit and goodybag but swap your SIM out for a new one.

You can only complete a SIM swap can only between 4:30 AM and 9:30 PM.

#### Perform a SIM swap here https://www.giffgaff.com/profile/details#simswap

You need any unactivated giffgaff SIM. You can get one from:
- 1. a member's affiliate link (click my name at the top of this post)
- 2. this link: https://www.giffgaff.com/orders/mgm
- 3. your local shop (Tesco, Asda, Co-op, etc.) for under Â£1

Options 1 and 2 involve having a SIM sent to your house via 1st Class Post. It should arrive within 1-3 working days.

The SIM swap process itself can take up to 24 hours to complete but usually only takes around 30 minutes.

#### You do not need to make a payment to perform a SIM swap.

If you get to a top-up step, [color=red]**STOP**[/color] and make sure you are logged into the giffgaff account which is linked to your phone number.

    content: `RateSetter are the company that manage loan applications for pay monthly phone purchases.

When buying a pay monthly phone, you'll go through a soft credit check by RateSetter. This will not affect your credit score. They will then decide whether or not to approve your loan application.

You'll know if you were approved or not as you'll be sent an email. This is sent by the end of the next working day (not 24 hours as some say).

If you're approved **you must click the link in the email to confirm your order.** If you don't you won't receive your phone and your application will expire, so you will have to go through the whole process over again.

If you decide you no longer want to buy the phone (for example you found a better deal elsewhere) then ignore the email. You won't be charged.

If you don't get an email after 2 business days, you should contain RateSetter. For contact details, click the button below.
