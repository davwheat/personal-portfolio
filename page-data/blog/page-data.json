It allows eNodeBs to transmit more than one stream of data at the same time to double, triple, quadruple (or more!) data throughput.","path":"2021/12/22/lte-mimo","created_at":"22 December 2021"},"id":"d8478302-b904-5cf2-82fc-3b02c04522e7","excerpt":"Introduction MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) is a way of increasing the throughput of a data connection by broadcasting and receiving…"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"LTE: why are high frequencies faster than low frequencies?","description":"While theoretical speed on different frequencies are identical on LTE, this is very rarely the case in the real world. Why is that?","path":"2021/10/11/speed-differences-high-low-frequencies","created_at":"11 October 2021"},"id":"37b0c57c-688a-5fe6-bca2-979c49aa703e","excerpt":"In the past  I have discussed duplexing modes  (FDD and TDD) to see how they affect speed on LTE and\n5G. In that article, I touched on the…"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Subcarriers, Resource Blocks and more in 4G and 5G","description":"OFDM allows multiple subcarriers within resource blocks to overlap significantly while producing little to no interference, allowing 5G to use its frequency allocation far more effectively.","path":"2021/08/21/ofdm-subcarriers-rb-in-4g-lte-and-5g","created_at":"21 August 2021"},"id":"233909e5-5d3e-53bc-b5c1-f448c5f50481","excerpt":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (more simply referred to as OFDM) allows multiple signals to overlap significantly while…"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Phone mast sectorisation and mast deployment patterns","description":"To provide mobile coverage to a large area, masts need to be deployed in sectors.
