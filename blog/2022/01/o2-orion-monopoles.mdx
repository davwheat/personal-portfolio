# A brief history

O2 (<Tooltip text="MCC: 234, MNC: 10"><code>234/10</code></Tooltip>) is the largest network operator in the United Kingdom in terms of customers.
Including its <Tooltip text="Mobile virtual network operators">MVNOs</Tooltip>, O2's customer base totals a whopping 36.2 million customers in a
country of just 67 million, meaning they have a market share of 54%.

In the past, O2 has had a fairly troublesome history in terms of capacity. Many parts of the UK which used to be more rural have expanded over
time, resulting in O2 sites which used to be more than capable of providing decent performance to customers within their zone painful to use.
This is extremely prevalent with their main deployments being 800 MHz LTE across rural and suburban United Kingdom.

# Introduction to Orion

In 2021, O2 launched its **Beacon 3** project, including its brand new, flagship Orion monopoles.

Orion monopoles manage to cram a multitude 4G bands, along with n28 and n78 5G all into one street cabinet and monopole, often replacing what
used to be basic 4G/3G/2G monopoles and several street cabinets.

O2 have begun to fall in love with these new deployments, because of their simplicity. A pole swap can be done in just one day, consisting of
contractors installing the feeders in the new cabinet, and an HIAB truck arriving with the new monopole, lifting and dropping it into place, and
then taking the old one away to be stripped for parts.

# Planning applications

For mobile networks to install new street infrastructure, they do not need to apply for planning permission. Instead, they must submit a notice
of **prior notification**. This is a notice of intent, basically saying "I'm doing something. Tell me if I can't.".

The local planning authority has **56 days to object to the plans, or approve them**. No response after 56 days is classed as an approval. The
big kick against conspiracy theorists is that **LPAs may only reject proposed development due to its siting or appearance**.

The compact nature of Orion monopole sites mean that councils are more likely to approve them compared to monopoles from other operators which
may clutter public areas with various street furniture.

## Exemptions

Exemptions exist from submtting prior notification plans, aimed to make minor changes easier for network operators. While they are meant for
swapping out equipment when it fails or for adding new microwave link dishes to sites, O2 have now been seen using these powers for performing
full-on Orion site swaps in some areas.

One of my local monopole sites in Burgess Hill, for example, has recently been swapped from a Beacon 2 site to a new dual operator Orion with no
prior notice submitted. This was possible due to one exemption:

> prior approval does not apply to ground-based masts which when altered or replaced would not exceed the greater of the height of the existing
> mast and 20m above ground level

Since my old local monopole was 20m in height, and so was the new Orion monopole, **the site could be swapped out without any form of approval
required**.

# Orion equipment

Orion installations differ significantly. The majority of site we've seen so far have been O2 unilateral (only O2) monopoles, using Ericsson
equipment. We've seen some Cornerstone shared sites (where O2 and Vodafone are both located on the monopole), though.

## Nokia vendor

My site was one of the first we'd seen in the wild using Nokia equipment. It was also a dual-operator site, with O2 and Vodafone both
broadcasting from it.

On the top of the monopole are three
[Commscope 24-port RRZZT4S4-65B-R6 antennae](https://www.commscope.com/product-type/antennas/base-station-antennas-equipment/base-station-antennas/itemrrzzt4s4-65b-r6/)
(that's a mouthful), each fully loaded with feeder cables. This is different from the Huawei passive antennae we had previously seen in Ericsson
zones.

The street furniture used was a single Yorkshire cabinet, while the previous three cabinets (one for each operator, plus one for power) were
removed as part of the upgrade on Day 4.

<FactBox title="It's worth knowing...">

The use of non-Huawei antennae in this Orion build **is not** related to the UK's ban on Huawei equipment in new 5G deployments, as that ban only
applies to active equipment.

</FactBox>

The site appears to be configured for:

- 5G
  - 8T8R 3500 MHz NR (n78)
  - 2T4R 700 MHz NR (n28)
- 4G
  - 8T8R 2300 MHz LTE (B40)
  - 4T4R 2100 MHz LTE (B1)
  - 2T2R 900 MHz LTE (B8)
  - 2T2R 800 MHz LTE (B20)

I am yet to fieldtest this site, so I cannot confirm this is the exact deployment, however.
