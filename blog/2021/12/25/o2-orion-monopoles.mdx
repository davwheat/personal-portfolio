# A brief history

O2 (<Tooltip text="MCC: 234, MCC: 10"><code>234/10</code></Tooltip>) is the largest network operator in the United Kingdom, in terms of
customers. Including its <Tooltip text="Mobile virtual network operators">MVNOs</Tooltip>, O2 has the largest share of mobile subscribers in the
UK, totalling 34.1 million customers.

In the past, O2 has had a fairly troublesome history in terms of capacity. Many parts of the UK which used to be more rural have expanded over
time, resulting in O2 sites which used to be more than capable of providing decent performance to customers within their zone painful to use.
This is extremely prevalent with their main deployments being 800 MHz LTE across rural and suburban United Kingdom.

# Approaches to capacity management

O2's approaches to capacity management have been successful to varying degrees, but all put together, they result in a positive impact in urban
areas, such as large towns and cities. This section won't cover everything, as that's deserving of its own separate page, and Peter already did a
great job at it.

## LTE 2300 MHz (B40) and MIMO

O2 holds a total of 40 MHz of unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz TDD band (LTE band 40), with the remaining 60 MHz being used by the Ministry of
Defence.

O2 B40 LTE sites are often deployed on 4T4R (4x4 MIMO), meaning they can transmit and receive four streams of data simultaneously, while some
Nokia vendor sites operate on 8T8R, with eight streams of data.

MIMO is a way of increasing the speed of a data connection by broadcasting multiple signal streams at once. Each stream is treated by the
environment slightly differently, in the sense that each stream is subject to different reflections, refractions and other conditions. While
often this would negatively impact performance, the technology behind MIMO relies on this philsophy, called **multiple path propogation**.

These slightly different conditions allow your device and the receiving antenna at the base station to more easily pick apart the signal streams
from one another (there is a higher signal-to-noise ratio/SINR), allowing the device to achieve higher 'ranks'.

Ranks are the way a device describes its current Tx/Rx stream capability. Rank 1 means that the device only has a high SINR on one of the
possible streams from the eNodeB. Rank 2 means there's a high SINR on two streams, rank 3 meaning three streams, and so on. Your phone will
continuously report its rank indicator to the eNodeB at intervals decided by the eNodeB during the LTE attach procedure. If your phone reports
rank 4, then the eNodeB knows that it can transmit on all four streams, and your phone will be able to receive all four of these.
