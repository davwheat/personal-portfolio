# A brief history

O2 (<Tooltip text="MCC: 234, MCC: 10"><code>234/10</code></Tooltip>) is the largest network operator in the United Kingdom, in terms of
customers. Including its <Tooltip text="Mobile virtual network operators">MVNOs</Tooltip>, O2 has the largest share of mobile subscribers in the
UK, totalling 34.1 million customers.

In the past, O2 has had a fairly troublesome history in terms of capacity. Many parts of the UK which used to be more rural have expanded over
time, resulting in O2 sites which used to be more than capable of providing decent performance to customers within their zone painful to use.
This is extremely prevalent with their main deployments being 800 MHz LTE across rural and suburban United Kingdom.

# Approaches to capacity management

O2's approaches to capacity management have been successful to varying degrees, but all put together, they result in a positive impact in urban
areas, such as large towns and cities. This section won't cover everything, as that's deserving of its own separate page, and Peter already did a
great job at it.

## LTE 2300 MHz (B40)

O2 holds a total of 40 MHz of unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz band, with the remaining 60 MHz being used by the Ministry of Defence.

  - RET - tilting the antenna
    - no longer motors -- phase control
    - altering the time antennas receive the signal changes the tilt
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_tilt
- feeder tag - CAL -> calibration port
  - for beams, esp high TRx levels
- n78 5G 8TRx
  - missing 5G RRUs
- Commscope antennas, rather than typical Huawei
  - high port config
