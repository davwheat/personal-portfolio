LTE (4G) functions on a wide range of frequencies. These frequency ranges are called bands, and are standardised across the world.

These frequencies range from as low as 410 MHz up to almost 6 GHz in some cases, but not all of these frequency bands are supported on every
device.

## How does frequency link to speed?

It doesn't really, and it's a common misconception of how radio frequency (RF) systems work. Frequency on its own makes no difference to the
speeds you can achieve on LTE.

The frequency is a **carrier frequency**, meaning that its only role is to carry the LTE signal. The signal itself is encoded into a channel with
a set width (such as 10 MHz or 20 MHz).

In fact, the data carried on that signal can be moved to any other frequency as long as the available bandwidth is the same. In the example
animation below, we can copy a 20 MHz bandwidth signal from 2100 MHz to 800 MHz without any loss in data.

The only way that frequency and speed are linked is in their ability to penetrate surfaces.

### Penetrating power

In general, lower frequency (longer wavelength) waves can pass more easily through dense substances. For example, you can hear bass notes from
music through walls more easily than you can hear singing.

<FactBox title="Bear with me...">

This might look pretty complex, but stick with the explanation. It's simpler than it looks, I promise!

</FactBox>

As a wave, such as radio waves, travel through materials, they lose some of their energy. While they travel through the air, energy loss is
minimal, allowing waves to travel for kilometres in ideal circumstances. When they travel through denser materials, such as brick or concrete,
they lose more energy.

There are two main equations that can be used to represent wave energy. One relates frequency to energy, and the other relates wavelength to
energy.

<MathBlock
  title="Wave energy equations"
  math="\text{wave energy} = \text{planck's constant} \times \text{frequency} \\ \text{wave energy} = \frac{\text{planck's constant}\times\text{speed of light}}{\text{wavelength}}"
  footer="True for all electromagnetic waves"
/>

Both $\text{speed of light}$ and $\text{planck's constant}$ are constant (values that don't change). This means that we can infer that **the
higher the frequency, the higher the wave's energy** and that **the lower the wavelength, the higher the wave's energy**. Wavelength and
frequency are directly linked: increasing frequency will decrease the wavelength, and vice versa. You can see this in the demo below.

When a wave passes through a material, it loses a proportion of its power for every metre it travels. This is referred to as the **attentuation
coefficient**. Materials with a high attentuation coefficient are less easily penetrated with waves, such as those from phone masts.

The power lost is dependent on the amount of energy present originally. A 20% decrease in power from 250 W would be 200 W, a reduction of 50 W.
However, a 20% reduction from 100 W is 80 W, a reduction of only 20 W.

Since lower frequency waves have lower energy and lower power from the beginning, less is lost when they pass through a material than a high
frequency.

This is most critically an issue with [newer 5G mmWave](https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-5g-mmwave-933631/), which uses frequencies
upwards of 26 GHz. These frequencies can be belowed using just sheets of paper, let alone brick walls or
[even just your hands](https://www.eetimes.com/mwc-are-your-5-fingers-blocking-your-5g/).

## Duplex modes

**Duplex** refers to the ability for a communication channel to transmit and receive data. LTE can be either **full duplex** (meaning that
transmitting and receiving can happen simulataneously), or **half duplex** (meaning that transmitting and receiving can happen, but not at the
same time).

Both LTE-TDD and LTE-FDD share the vast majority of their core infrastructure, allowing chipset and modem manufacturers to more easily support
both modes with one single chip.

### Time-division Duplex (TDD)

Time-division Duplex works by using one single frequency, and by switching between uploading and downloading over time. The proportion of time
spent uploading or downloading can be changed on-the-fly to account for longer periods spent mainly downloading or uploading.

There needs to be a small period in between the transition from uplink to downlink and vice versa. This is called the **guard period** or guard
interval. This is used to ensure one device's transmission is fully received before the other begins to transmit. This period must get longer as
the devices grow further apart, resulting in significant throughput loss over long distances.

LTE-TDD is mainly used at higher frequencies, covering bands between 1850 MHz and 3800 MHz. The LTE-TDD spectrum allocation is normally cheaper
than LTE-FDD and also has less traffic.

### Frequency-division Duplex (FDD)

Frequency-division duplex works by using two different frequencies, where each is dedicated to either upload or download only.

For FDD to work, networks need to use paired frequencies. For example, 800 MHz Band 20 uses an offset spacing of $-41\text{ MHz}$, meaning that
downlink frequencies are found $-41\text{ MHz}$ from uplink frequencies (e.g. if uplink is at 800 MHz, then downlink is at 769 MHz). As this
spectrum must be paired and purchased in these sets, it's often much more expensive to set up and run than LTE-TDD due to licensing costs.

As the frequencies for uplink and downlink are locked for each network, it is hard for them to dynamically change their speeds. When using TDD,
networks can dynamically set the amount of time that is spent either uploading or downloading, but with FDD the relationship is fixed to the
spectrum allocations owned.
